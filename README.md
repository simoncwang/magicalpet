### Setup and Installations ###
In order to setup the app to run Magical Pet on your computer, you need a Python virtual environment. To set this up, run the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv <name of virtual environment>
```
Then enter the virtual environment. Mac users should run ```source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate```. Windows users should run ```<name of virtual environment>\Scripts\activate```.

Ensure that your prompt changes in the terminal to include the name of your virtual environment, indicating that you are inside the environment.

Install all the libraries by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

Run the application: ```python3 main.py```

The application will prompt you to push the according button on the turtle shell to run the application in either audio or video mode.
